<p>The figure on the right shows the widget that will appear when you want to add a line plot.</p>
<p>The first line shows you the name of the loaded file for which you choosed to draw the scatter plot.
On the second line, you have a text field (with ‘histogram number X’ by default). This is where you enter
The <em>delete button</em> allows you to remove the scatterp lot from the plot and also all the associated widgets in the graphic element panel.
The <em>X:</em> and <em>Y:</em> widgets ask for the column corresponding to the X and Y axis of your plot from your input catalog.
The <em>color</em> widget makes you change the color of each points.
The <em>linestyle</em> widget allows you to change the line style of your line (dot, dashed…).
The slidebar allows one to change the tickness of the line.
The <em>fill between</em> and associated color list choice will fill the space between your plot and the x-axis
with the chosen color.
The checkbox <em>barplot</em> will transform your line plot to a line-bar plot. Instead of creating line directly from the poin it will draw steps at each point.
Finally, the spinbox with number allows you to smooth your line plot by a gaussian filter. The width of the gaussian filter is given by the number chosen in the spinbox.</p>

The <em>delete button</em> allows you to remove the band plot from the plot and also all the associated widgets in the graphic element panel.
Then you have to give <em>X</em>, <em>Y1</em>, <em>Y2</em>. Photon will create a plot filled with color between Y1 and Y2.
The <em>color Band</em> widget allows you to select the filling color.
Finally the <em>zorder</em> parameter allows you to choose how all the elements of the plot are pilled up (which one is on top of eachother).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">It is worth mentionning that the fill_between method of matplotlib does not have a label argumnet. Therefore a line is created at the mean of <em>Y1</em> and <em>Y2</em> with the same color and same zorder as the band (it is therefore invisible).

Then you have the label for the color bar with <em>color bar label</em>.
As previsouxly the <em>X:</em> and <em>Y:</em> ask for the column corresponding to the X and Y axis of your plot from your input catalog. Now you have a third column to give (Z) that corresponds to the data given by the color bar.
The <em>colorbar</em> widget makes you change the color of each points.
The <em>vmin</em> and <em>vmax</em> will give the opportunity to modify the limits of the color bar.

<p>The first line shows you the loaded file for which you choosed to draw the histogram.
On the second line, you have a text field (with ‘histogram number X’ by default). This is where you enter
the label of the histogram that will be displayed in the legend (can be left blank).
As usual the delete button allows you to remove the histogram from the plot and also all the associated widgets in the graphic element panel.</p>
<p>Then, the ‘<em>X:</em>’ widget ask you to choose the column of the input catalog whom the histogram is drawn from.
The <em>Binning</em> widget allows you to choose the binning of the histogram. It need 3 numbers in the format
‘xi, xf, dx’. Where ‘xi’ is the first bin, xf is the last one and dx the width of each bin.
The <em>color</em> widget provides all the available colors.
The <em>histtype</em> multiple choice widget let you choose between different histogram type (bars, steps, filledsteps…).
If you choose the ‘steps’ style, it will just draw the contour of the histogram with a line. In that case
you can choose the linestyle in the widget <em>linestyle</em>.
Two slidebars are displayed after. The first controls the transparency of the histogram, and the second controls the tickness of the line.
Finally, a check box <em>norm</em> allows one to normalise the histogram. It will recompute all the bins so the sum of all of them is equal to one.</p>

</div>
<p>The figure on the right shows the widget that will appear when you want to add a plot with error bars.
This kind of plot are basically equivalent to scatter plots but with some more information on how to plot the error bars</p>
<p>The first line shows you the name of the loaded file for which you choosed to draw the errorbar plot.
On the second line, you have a text field (with ‘Errorbar plot number X’ by default). This is where you enter the label that will go into the legend of the plot.
The <em>delete button</em> allows you to remove the errorbar plot from the plot and also all the associated widgets in the graphic element panel.
As previsously the <em>X:</em> and <em>Y:</em> ask for the column corresponding to the X and Y axis of your plot from your input catalog.</p>
<p>Then, you have to give <strong>four</strong> columns for the error bars. As errors ccan be asymetric two values are need along X and two values are also needed along Y.
Along X, you have to give the two errors with the widgets <em>Xerr+</em> and <em>Xerr-</em>.
ALong Y, you have to give the two errors with the widgets <em>Yerr+</em> and <em>Yerr-</em>.</p>
<p>Then, you can choose the color (it will be the same for the marker and the errorbars) with the <em>color</em> widget.
Additionaly you can set the size of the marker using the <em>size</em> spinbox.
The empty marker checkbox allows you to transform your marker (e.g. circles, squares, pentagons…) into empty marker where just the contour is displayed (see the warning above when checking this option).
The two last slidebars make you control the tickness of the line drawing the marker and the transparency.
Finally you can control the tickness of the errorbars and the size of the errorbar cap using the spinboxes <em>error bar tickness</em> and <em>error bar cap size</em>.</p>

On the same line you have the zscale checkbox that allows you to display the image with the ds9-like zscale colormap levels.</p>
<p>On the next line you have the possibility of changing the colormap. The list depends shows all the colorbars contained in matplotlib.</p>
<p>The last 3 lines allows you to plot contours over the image. To use them you have to check the ‘Contour’ checkbox and provide a threshold level. The scrollbar allows you to change the linewidth of the contour and the last line provide a list of colors for the contour line.</p>

As usual the delete button allows you to remove the strip from the plot and also all the associated widgets in the graphic element panel.</p>
<p>The widget <em>coordinates</em> require two or three numbers. If you choose between ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ lines, three numbers will be required. For example, if you choose vertical, you will have to give the X-coodinate, and the y-coordinate indicating the limits of the line you want to draw. If you choose ‘diagonal’ it will draw the line x=y and you have to give the limits on the plot in the format ‘xmin, xmax’.
The widget <em>color</em> allows you to choose the color you want.
The widget <em>linestyle</em> change the linestyle of the line.
And finally the <em>slide bar</em> will help you to change the tickness of the line.</p>

<p>The text field (coming with an ‘text’ entry) is where you write the text you want to display.
It can use Latex font. Then the coordinates field (coming by default at ‘0.3, 0.7’) is where you
must give the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the text. The format is ‘x,y’.
Then, the slidebar allows you to play with the size of the text.
Finally the angle (from 0 degree to 360) allows one to rotate the text.</p>

<h2>Save a plot configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#save-a-plot-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once your plot is finalized you can save all the configuration by clicking on the button ‘save plot’ (at the top of the Grapical element panel).
Doing so will create a configuration file containing all your graphical elements input. Later on you can use this configuration plot and load it back to
photon using the ‘-p’ argument. It will load all the widget and you will be able to modify your plot from where you stopped.
